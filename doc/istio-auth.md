# Securing Communication Between Services

**NOTE: This feature is under implementation.**

## Configure Istio Auth

Istio auth enforces mutual-TLS for proxy-to-proxy traffic, to provide authentication and security for the intra-cluster
traffic. Istio auth is transparent to the backend applications. Proxies use the service accounts (the identities of the
pods that the serivce is running on) to authenticate the other side. Currently, Istio auth can only be enabled
cluster-wise, through istio manager command line flag.

### Command Line Flags

Istio manager agent uses the following flags to configure Istio auth:

- **enable_auth** Default value *false*. When true, enforces mTLS auth for all proxy-proxy traffic.
- **auth_config_path** Default value *"/etc/certs"*. When "enable_auth" is true, proxy reads mTLS config files from this path.

### Auth Config Files

For the proxy to do mTLS authentication, the Istio manager needs to mount the following files to the *auth_config_path*.
These files can be generated by [Istio CA](https://github.com/istio/auth). They should be mounted into
*auth_config_path* when the proxy starts (for example, mounted as *volume* in Kubernetes).

- **cert-chain.pem** The certificate chain for the proxy.
- **key.pem** The private key for the proxy.
- **root-cert.pem** The root certificates the proxy uses to authenticate other proxies.
